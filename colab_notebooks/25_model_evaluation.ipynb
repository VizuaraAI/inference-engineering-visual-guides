    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.\"** Model evaluation is the backbone of any serious AI system. Without robust evals, you're flying blind -- you don't know if your model is getting better, worse, or just different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Evals Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | What Could Go Wrong Without Evals |\n",
    "|----------|-----------------------------------|\n",
    "| Prompt engineering | Changes that feel better but are actually worse |\n",
    "| Model upgrades | New model excels at some tasks but regresses on others |\n",
    "| Fine-tuning | Overfitting to training data, losing general capability |\n",
    "| Production monitoring | Silent degradation over time |\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Designing evaluation prompts** for specific domains\n",
    "2. **Multiple eval metrics**: Exact match, BLEU, ROUGE, LLM-as-judge\n",
    "3. **Building a benchmark suite** from scratch\n",
    "4. **Visualizing results** with radar charts and comparison plots\n",
    "5. **Creating custom eval datasets**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Basic Python and understanding of LLM outputs\n",
    "- No GPU required for this notebook (CPU is sufficient)"

    "Good evals start with good eval prompts. The key principles are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specificity**: Each eval should test exactly one capability\n",
    "2. **Determinism**: Clear expected outputs for automated scoring\n",
    "3. **Coverage**: Test edge cases, not just happy paths\n",

    "| **Multiple Metrics** | No single metric captures everything -- use a suite |\n",
    "| **Key Fact Coverage** | Simple but powerful for factual accuracy |\n",
    "| **BLEU/ROUGE** | Good for n-gram overlap, but can miss semantic meaning |\n",
